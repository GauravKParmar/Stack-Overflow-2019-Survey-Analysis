# Stack Overflow 2019 Survey Analysis

### Analysis of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results

I decided to analyze the annual data from the public Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results. A total of 88,883 people responded to the survey with being asked a variety of questions. Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it.

### Here are a few questions to the 2019 database I prompted:

- Question 1: What are the top 10 popular programming languages?
- Question 2: What is the amount of job satisfaction among the respondents who are working full time?
- Question 3: Which country has the highest number of respondents in the survey?

### Blog post detailing results for public: As a Udacity student, I created a blog post in response to my findings:
